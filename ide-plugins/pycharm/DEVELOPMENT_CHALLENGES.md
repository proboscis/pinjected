# PyCharm Plugin Development: Challenges and Solutions

During the development of the PyCharm plugin for Python dependency injection analysis, we encountered several challenges. Here's a history of the problems faced and how they were resolved:

## 1. IntelliJ Platform API Configuration Issues

**Problem**: The initial Gradle build configuration used `intellijPlatform` blocks that weren't recognized by the Gradle IntelliJ plugin.

**Solution**: Updated to the standard Gradle IntelliJ plugin configuration format:
```kotlin
intellij {
    version.set("2024.3")
    type.set("PY")
    plugins.set(listOf("python"))
}
```

## 2. Plugin Dependencies Configuration

**Problem**: The plugin.xml included a dependency on `com.intellij.python` which caused errors during build as this ID wasn't correctly specified.

**Solution**: Simplified the dependencies in plugin.xml to only include the essential modules:
```xml
<depends>com.intellij.modules.platform</depends>
<depends>com.intellij.modules.python</depends>
```

## 3. Deprecated API Usage

**Problem**: Used the deprecated `PyPackageManager` API for checking installed packages, which generated warnings and compatibility issues.

**Solution**: Created a simplified implementation that avoids using deprecated APIs, with a placeholder that returns `true` for package checks (with a comment indicating how this would be implemented in a production version).

## 4. Python PSI API Parameter Signature Mismatch

**Problem**: Calls to `pyClass.findMethodByName("__init__")` were failing because the method signature required additional parameters.

**Solution**: Updated the method calls to include the required parameters:
```java
TypeEvalContext context = TypeEvalContext.codeInsightFallback(pyClass.getProject());
PyFunction initMethod = pyClass.findMethodByName("__init__", false, context);
```

## 5. Service Manager API Changes

**Problem**: Initially used the outdated `service(PInjectDesignSettings.class)` pattern for service access, which wasn't compatible with the current platform version.

**Solution**: Updated to the current Application service pattern:
```java
PInjectDesignSettings settings = ApplicationManager.getApplication().getService(PInjectDesignSettings.class);
```

## 6. Type Annotation Information Access

**Problem**: Attempted to access Python type annotations via `param.getAnnotation()` which wasn't available in the API.

**Solution**: Simplified the implementation to only collect parameter names without their type annotations, with a comment explaining the limitation.

## 7. Gradle Wrapper Missing JAR

**Problem**: The Gradle wrapper was created but the essential `gradle-wrapper.jar` file was missing, causing build failures.

**Solution**: Downloaded and added the correct Gradle wrapper JAR file, although this required manual intervention due to curl restrictions.

## 8. Building the Plugin Distribution

**Problem**: The build process was complicated by IDE sandbox instances launching during the build, causing timeouts and unnecessary output.

**Solution**: Used appropriate Gradle tasks specifically (`buildPlugin` for creating the distribution without running the IDE). The resulting plugin artifacts were correctly placed in the sandbox directory.

## 9. ServiceManager Deprecation

**Problem**: Used the deprecated `ServiceManager.getService()` API which isn't recommended in newer IntelliJ Platform versions.

**Solution**: Replaced with the newer pattern using `ApplicationManager.getApplication().getService()` for obtaining service instances.

## Key Takeaways:

1. **API Evolution**: IntelliJ Platform APIs evolve rapidly. Always refer to the latest documentation.

2. **Proper Dependency Management**: Ensure plugin dependencies are correctly specified in both Gradle and plugin.xml files.

3. **Sandbox Testing**: The plugin verification process launches IDE instances, which can be resource-intensive but ensures compatibility.

4. **Service Patterns**: Service component access patterns have changed in newer platform versions, requiring updates to the code.

5. **PyCharm-Specific APIs**: Working with Python-specific APIs requires careful attention to the PyCharm plugin documentation.

These challenges highlighted the importance of staying current with the IntelliJ Platform Plugin SDK documentation and properly configuring the Gradle build for PyCharm plugin development.
