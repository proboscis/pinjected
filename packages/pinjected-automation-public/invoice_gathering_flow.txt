Important Notes:
- Today's date: 2024-11-05
- Target invoice period: October 2024
- Need to handle team switching carefully - dropdown closes when clicking elsewhere
- Must wait 5 seconds after each download
- Do not download "請求書" - only "領収書"
- CSV format: team_name, invoice id, amount, create date
