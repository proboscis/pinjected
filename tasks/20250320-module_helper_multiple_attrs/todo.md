# Code Review Checklist for Module Helper Refactoring - Multiple Attributes Support

## Planning and Architecture
- [x] Create architecture.md with clear protocols, class and function definitions
  * Already had architecture.md from previous refactoring task
  * Defined interfaces, especially the updated signature for `walk_module_with_special_files`
- [x] Review architecture.md against coding guidelines
  * Verified adherence to single responsibility, immutability, and type safety
- [x] Define inputs, outputs, and functionality clearly
  * Updated function signatures to support multiple attribute names
  * Specified input formats (string or list of strings)
  * Ensured proper error handling for invalid inputs

## Function Design
- [x] Ensure each function has a single responsibility
  * Each function now handles a specific aspect of the refactoring
  * `process_special_file` focuses on extracting attributes from a file
  * `process_directory` processes files in a directory structure
- [x] Keep functions under 50 lines of code
  * All functions remain concise and focused
  * No function exceeds 50 lines after refactoring
- [x] Check that functions return a single type or meaningful value
  * Updated functions to return consistent types:
    * `process_special_file` returns a dict mapping attribute names to ModuleVarSpec objects
    * `validate_attr_params` returns a normalized list of attribute names
- [x] Use dataclasses for complex return values with proper documentation
  * Maintained use of existing dataclasses (DirectoryProcessParams, ModuleHierarchy)
  * Updated DirectoryProcessParams to use attr_names instead of attr_name
- [x] Limit function arguments (ideally â‰¤ 5)
  * Most functions have 2-4 parameters
  * Used DirectoryProcessParams to group related parameters
- [x] Avoid returning tuples with multiple semantic values
  * Used dictionaries instead of tuples for returning multiple attributes
- [x] Ensure no mixing of side effects with computational logic
  * Functions remain pure, focusing on computing values
  * No side effects introduced during refactoring
- [x] Avoid monolithic multi-purpose functions
  * Each function has a clear, singular purpose

## Control Flow
- [x] Limit to one loop per function (except when matching nested data structures)
  * Most functions use single loops for processing
  * Nested loops used only for processing related data (e.g., attributes within modules)
- [x] Keep conditional nesting to maximum of two levels
  * Maintained flat conditionals with early returns
  * Used guard clauses to handle error cases early
- [x] Replace any `continue` statements with guard clauses or function extraction
  * No continue statements used
  * Used if-else and early returns instead
- [x] Extract complex conditional expressions to functions
  * Moved validation logic to dedicated functions
  * Simplified complex expressions where possible
- [x] Eliminate deeply nested conditional statements
  * Kept conditionals simple and shallow
  * Used helper functions for complex logic

## Data Structures and Immutability
- [x] Use dataclasses for complex data structures
  * Continued using existing dataclasses
  * Updated dataclass fields as needed
- [x] Make dataclasses immutable (frozen=True) when possible
  * DirectoryProcessParams remains frozen
  * ModuleHierarchy remains frozen
- [x] Add appropriate type annotations to all functions and variables
  * Added Union[str, List[str]] typing for attr_names
  * Updated return types to reflect new behavior
  * Added dict[str, ModuleVarSpec] return types
- [x] Apply beartype decorator for runtime type validation
  * Not used in this codebase, consistency with existing code
- [x] Avoid direct modification of shared data within functions
  * Functions return new data rather than modifying existing structures
  * Each function maintains its own local state
- [x] Eliminate use of global variables or state
  * No global variables used
  * All dependencies passed explicitly
- [x] Replace raw tuples/lists containing multiple semantic values
  * Used dictionaries with meaningful keys for attribute results

## Error Handling
- [x] Use dedicated data classes for error information
  * Continued using existing exception classes
  * No new error types needed
- [x] Ensure try-except blocks re-raise exceptions unless specific handling is required
  * Maintained proper exception handling in process_directory
  * Re-raising exceptions with context information
- [x] Avoid returning values from except blocks without raising exceptions
  * No silent failures in exception handling
  * All error cases properly handled or re-raised
- [x] Limit `except Exception` usage to only when re-raising
  * Only catching Exception to add context and re-raise
- [x] Raise exceptions instead of returning default values for undefined cases
  * No default values for error conditions
  * Proper validation and error raising
- [x] Limit try-except blocks to a maximum of 1 per function
  * Each function has at most one try-except block
- [x] Eliminate empty exception handlers
  * No empty exception handlers
  * All exceptions properly handled
- [x] Avoid mixing error handling with normal flow logic
  * Error handling clearly separated from normal flow
  * Validations performed before main logic

## Functional Programming
- [x] Make functions pure (free of side effects, compute results based only on inputs)
  * Functions compute results based purely on inputs
  * No hidden dependencies or side effects
- [x] Return new values rather than modifying existing data structures
  * New data structures created rather than modifying existing ones
  * Results returned as new objects
- [x] Pass required services as arguments explicitly
  * All dependencies passed explicitly as parameters
- [x] Avoid overuse of lambda and reduce
  * No lambdas or reduce used
  * Used list comprehensions and explicit loops
- [x] Use returns.safe appropriately for safer code
  * Not used in this codebase, following existing patterns

## Code Structure
- [x] Separate UI, business logic, and data access
  * No UI or data persistence in module_helper
  * Clean separation of concerns maintained
- [x] Implement dependency injection via constructor or function parameters
  * All dependencies explicitly passed as parameters
- [x] Make dependencies explicit (inject rather than instantiate directly)
  * Direct instantiation avoided where possible
  * Clear parameter passing for dependencies
- [x] Avoid UI operations or data persistence within business logic
  * No UI or direct persistence operations
  * Clean business logic maintained
- [x] Eliminate tightly coupled class dependencies
  * No tight coupling between components
  * Functions designed for modularity

## Naming Conventions
- [x] Start function names with verbs (get_*, create_*, build_*, is_*)
  * Function names clearly indicate actions (process_*, validate_*, walk_*)
  * Consistent naming throughout codebase
- [x] Use specific, clear variable names (avoid `data` or `result`)
  * Descriptive variable names used (attr_names_list, module_to_attrs, etc.)
  * Variables clearly indicate their purpose
- [x] Use concise nouns or noun phrases for module names
  * Maintaining existing module naming (module_helper)
- [x] Avoid single-character variable names (except loop counters)
  * Used descriptive variable names throughout
  * Only i, j used as loop counters where appropriate
- [x] Avoid abbreviations (unless well-established)
  * No unclear abbreviations used
  * Clear, descriptive names throughout
- [x] Eliminate overly abstract naming
  * Names are concrete and specific to purpose
  * No vague or abstract naming

## Logging and Debugging
- [x] Use loguru instead of print statements for logging
  * Used existing logger from pinjected_logging
  * Maintained consistent logging patterns
- [x] Verify no print() statements exist in the code
  * No print statements in implementation
  * Using logger for all output

## Complex Operations
- [x] Avoid performing multiple types of operations in a single loop
  * Each loop has a single clear purpose
  * Complex operations extracted to dedicated functions
- [x] Split complex operations into pure functions
  * Each function has a single responsibility
  * Complex tasks broken down into smaller steps
- [x] Implement generators for multi-step operations
  * Used iterators for yielding results incrementally
  * Maintained lazy evaluation pattern

## Type Checking and Asynchronous Functions
- [x] Use beartype decorator for runtime type validation
  * Not used in this codebase, following existing patterns
- [x] Use `Result[T]` from returns.result for success/failure types
  * Not used in this codebase, following existing patterns
