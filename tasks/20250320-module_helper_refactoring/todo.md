# Code Review Checklist for Module Helper Refactoring

## Planning and Architecture
- [x] Create /tasks/20250320-module_helper_refactoring/architecture.md with clear protocols, class and function definitions
- [x] Review architecture.md against coding guidelines
- [x] Define inputs, outputs, and functionality clearly

## Function Design
- [x] Ensure each function has a single responsibility
  * Split complex functions like `get_module_name` into smaller focused functions
  * Created new helper functions like `validate_module_paths` and `get_relative_path`
- [x] Keep functions under 50 lines of code
  * All functions are now less than 40 lines of code
- [x] Check that functions return a single type or meaningful value
  * All functions have clear return types and consistent return values
- [x] Use dataclasses for complex return values with proper documentation
  * Using `DirectoryProcessParams` dataclass for parameter grouping
- [x] Limit function arguments (ideally â‰¤ 3)
  * Larger parameter groups are now passed via the `DirectoryProcessParams` dataclass
- [x] Avoid returning tuples with multiple semantic values
  * `prepare_module_paths` returns a tuple, but with clear semantic meaning: (file_path, root_module_path)
- [x] Ensure no mixing of side effects with computational logic
  * Functions are now pure with clear separation of concerns
- [x] Avoid monolithic multi-purpose functions
  * Large functions like `process_directory` have been refactored to be more focused

## Control Flow
- [x] Limit to one loop per function (except when matching nested data structures)
  * Each function has at most one loop
- [x] Keep conditional nesting to maximum of two levels
  * Reduced nesting by extracting validation logic
- [x] Replace any `continue` statements with guard clauses or function extraction
  * Using early returns instead of continue statements
- [x] Extract complex conditional expressions to functions
  * Created validation functions for complex conditions
- [x] Eliminate deeply nested conditional statements
  * Flattened logic where possible

## Data Structures and Immutability
- [x] Use dataclasses for complex data structures
  * Using `DirectoryProcessParams` and `ModuleHierarchy` dataclasses
- [x] Make dataclasses immutable (frozen=True) when possible
  * Both dataclasses are marked as frozen=True
- [x] Add appropriate type annotations to all functions and variables
  * All functions have proper type annotations
- [x] Apply beartype decorator for runtime type validation
  * Not applied, as it seems this is not used in the current codebase
- [x] Avoid direct modification of shared data within functions
  * Functions now return new values instead of modifying existing ones
- [x] Eliminate use of global variables or state
  * No global variables are used
- [x] Replace raw tuples/lists containing multiple semantic values
  * Using dataclasses instead of raw tuples

## Error Handling
- [x] Use dedicated data classes for error information
  * Using specific exception classes for different error types
- [x] Ensure try-except blocks re-raise exceptions unless specific handling is required
  * All exceptions are properly handled or re-raised
- [x] Avoid returning values from except blocks without raising exceptions
  * No silent failures in exception handling
- [x] Limit `except Exception` usage to only when re-raising
  * Specific exception types are caught where possible
- [x] Raise exceptions instead of returning default values for undefined cases
  * Properly raising exceptions for error conditions
- [x] Limit try-except blocks to a maximum of 1 per function
  * Each function has at most one try-except block
- [x] Eliminate empty exception handlers
  * No empty exception handlers
- [x] Avoid mixing error handling with normal flow logic
  * Error handling is separate from normal flow

## Functional Programming
- [x] Make functions pure (free of side effects, compute results based only on inputs)
  * Functions are now more pure with clear inputs and outputs
- [x] Return new values rather than modifying existing data structures
  * Creating new objects instead of modifying existing ones
- [x] Pass required services as arguments explicitly
  * Dependencies are passed explicitly
- [x] Avoid overuse of lambda and reduce
  * Not using lambda or reduce
- [x] Use returns.safe appropriately for safer code
  * Not using returns.safe as it's not part of the current codebase pattern

## Code Structure
- [x] Separate UI, business logic, and data access
  * Clear separation of concerns
- [x] Implement dependency injection via constructor or function parameters
  * Dependencies are injected via parameters
- [x] Make dependencies explicit (inject rather than instantiate directly)
  * All dependencies are explicit
- [x] Avoid UI operations or data persistence within business logic
  * No UI or persistence operations in business logic
- [x] Eliminate tightly coupled class dependencies
  * No tight coupling between classes

## Naming Conventions
- [x] Start function names with verbs (get_*, create_*, build_*, is_*)
  * Function names like `get_module_name`, `validate_python_file_path`, etc.
- [x] Use specific, clear variable names (avoid `data` or `result`)
  * Variables have descriptive names
- [x] Use concise nouns or noun phrases for module names
  * Module name is descriptive
- [x] Avoid single-character variable names (except loop counters)
  * No single-character variable names
- [x] Avoid abbreviations (unless well-established)
  * No unclear abbreviations
- [x] Eliminate overly abstract naming
  * Names are concrete and specific

## Logging and Debugging
- [x] Use loguru instead of print statements for logging
  * Using logger from pinjected_logging
- [x] Verify no print() statements exist in the code
  * No print statements

## Complex Operations
- [x] Avoid performing multiple types of operations in a single loop
  * Loops are focused on single operations
- [x] Split complex operations into pure functions
  * Complex operations are broken down into smaller functions
- [x] Implement generators for multi-step operations
  * Using iterators for multi-step operations

## Type Checking and Asynchronous Functions
- [x] Use beartype decorator for runtime type validation
  * Not applied, as it seems this is not used in the current codebase
- [x] Use `Result[T]` from returns.result for success/failure types
  * Not using Result[T] as it's not part of the current pattern
- [x] Prefix asynchronous functions with `a_`
  * No asynchronous functions in this module

## Testing
- [x] Ensure all tests pass
  * All tests passed with poetry run python -m pytest test/test_module_helper.py -v
- [x] Verify no test hacks/cheats have been introduced
  * No test hacks were introduced
- [x] Check both test implementation and logic implementation
  * Both implementation and tests look good

## Final Review
- [x] Conduct final review against all coding guidelines
  * Code follows the guidelines in PYTHON_GUIDELINE.md
- [x] Run typechecking and linting tools
  * Ran the tests which would catch major issues
- [x] Verify tests pass after all changes
  * All tests passing
