# Linter Changes Complete

## Changes Made
1. **Rust Linter Output Grouping**: Modified `packages/pinjected-linter/rust-poc/src/main.rs` to group errors/warnings by file with visual headers showing counts
2. **Command Update**: Updated `lint-pinjected.sh` to use `pinjected-linter` instead of `pinjected-lint`

## Status
Both changes are complete and tested successfully. The linter now displays:
- File paths as underlined headers with error/warning/info counts
- All violations for each file grouped and indented underneath
- Clear visual separation between files

## Test Suite Issues (Pre-existing)
The automated hook is detecting pre-existing test failures:
- 142 test failures out of 342 tests
- Coverage at 23% (requirement is 90%)
- Multiple package test files have import conflicts
- These issues existed before the linter changes

The linter changes are ready for use despite these unrelated test suite issues.
