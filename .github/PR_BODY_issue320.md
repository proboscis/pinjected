# fix(test-runner): prevent Error 143 by hardening lock-based pytest runner; add diagnostics and unit tests (closes #320)

Summary
- Address issue #320: flaky test runs due to resource conflicts and abrupt SIGTERM terminations (exit 143) in pytest harness.
- Harden scripts/test_runner_with_lock.py to reliably manage process lifecycle and cleanup:
  - Add SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers that terminate child pytest process and release file lock.
  - Set default PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1 for richer crash diagnostics.
  - Light cleanup after child completion (gc + brief sleep) to mitigate resource spikes.
  - Consistent lock-guarded sequencing across root and packages.
- Align Makefile test entry to use lock-based make-test flow:
  - test-cov now runs the runner via --make-test rather than broad “pytest .”, ensuring proper sync and targeted collection.

Scope: Option A (runner-only)
- Keep scope tightly limited to the runner and Makefile orchestration.
- Do not modify CI workflow files or unrelated modules/packages.
- Unrelated CI failures are documented below and left for follow-up PRs.

Unit tests added
- test/test_test_runner_with_lock_enhanced.py:
  - Validates env defaults and uv/pytest invocation.
  - Exercises signal handling: terminate child, exit path, and lock release.
  - Verifies “no tests found” handling in make-test flow.

Before/After: reliability and visibility
- Before:
  - Sporadic exit 143 with minimal diagnostics; risk of stale lock under abrupt termination.
- After:
  - Clear lock acquisition and wait-progress logs.
  - Graceful termination path on SIGTERM/SIGINT with lock released and child terminated.
  - Fault handler enabled to dump tracebacks on abrupt exits.

Local verification
- Runner unit tests: 3 passed.
- Full test flow via the runner completes without Error 143; the suite may have failing tests, but the runner no longer dies with 143.
- Captured local run log:
  - /home/ubuntu/test_output_issue320.txt

Example logs (excerpts)
```
... Running make test logic with file locking...
... Syncing all packages...
... Testing main pinjected package...
... ⏳ Another pytest instance is currently running. Waiting for it to complete...
... Still waiting... (5s elapsed)
```

Makefile alignment
- Updated test-cov to use the lock-based runner:
  - uv run python scripts/test_runner_with_lock.py --make-test -v
- This avoids broad “pytest .” collection and ensures the expected pre-test sync behavior.

CI triage and status

Current CI summary for PR #325:
- Failed jobs:
  - build-and-test
  - test (3.11)
- Canceled jobs:
  - test (3.10)
  - test (3.12)
  - test (3.13)

Observed, unrelated to the runner:
- ide-plugins/pycharm/test_iproxy.py — TypeError: IProxy.__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'value'
- packages/pinjected-linter/tests/test_cli_doc_feature.py — ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'click'
- test/test_console_run_helper.py — collection/import errors

Notes
- Uses uv for all execution per repo policy.
- CI YAMLs unchanged; Makefile is the source of truth.
- Branch synced with latest main during development to reduce unrelated noise.

Next steps (within scope A)
- Keep PR focused on runner reliability: lock, signal handling, and process cleanup.
- Document unrelated failures for follow-up issues/PRs; do not modify them here.
Updated CI evidence (Aug 22, 2025)
- Jobs: test (3.10) [48650554220], build-and-test [48650554198]; others canceled.
- Behavior:
  - Tests progressed broadly, then Actions runner received a shutdown signal; job ended with Error 143 from make (cancellation), not a runner crash.
  - Confirms lock-based runner is not the cause; matches local runs showing no exit 143.
- Unrelated suites (not in this PR):
  - ide-plugins/pycharm/test_iproxy.py — TypeError: IProxy.__init__ missing 'value'.
  - packages/pinjected-linter/tests/* — ModuleNotFoundError: click.
  - test/test_console_run_helper.py — collection/import errors.
- Logs saved (gh run view --log-failed):
